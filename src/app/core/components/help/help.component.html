      <li class="text-sm"> There are two ways for users to log in: by entering their email and password, or by using social login. If the user has a Google account, they can directly log in by entering their credentials.
        However, even if Google login is used,</li> 
      <li class="text-sm"> If the user wants to log in using the email and password method later, they need to click on "register" once to provide separate email and password inputs.</li>
      <li class="text-sm">In case of a forgotten password, clicking on "forgot password" will prompt the user to enter their email. After entering the email and clicking the button, they will be directed to a screen where they can enter a new password.</li>
      <li class="text-sm"> After entering the new password on the prompted screen, the user can go back to "https://offprice.store" and log in with the newly set password.</li>
